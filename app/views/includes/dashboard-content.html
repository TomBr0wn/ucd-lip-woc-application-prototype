  Ask the court to try to recover your money
</h1>

<p>You can ask the court to try and get your money back if {{ data['defendant-name'] }} has not paid you.</p>
<p>You cannot apply if they’ve entered breathing space.</p>
<p>You’ll need to pay a fee to apply – the court adds this fee to the money owed to you. The court cannot guarantee you’ll get your money back.</p>
